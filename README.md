##Things To Install On Every Computer
These are the applications, CLIs, and packages that I install on every computer. For work and for personal life, I use a Macbook Pro. That said, I'm waiting for the day when I can sensibly switch back to a less overpriced computer :)

General Applications:
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/): Takes the blue light out of your display when it gets dark. Without this, eternal headaches.
- [Slack Desktop](https://slack.com/is): My favorite platform of work communications.
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/): My current goto for note-taking on mobile and desktop.
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): Quick way to resize and reposition windows with your keyboard. 
- [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/): I think this is the easiest way to start a Postgres server.
- [Caffeine](https://caffeine.en.softonic.com/mac): Stop your computer from going to sleep while it's doing important stuff.
- [Google Chrome](): My daily driver, but I also install the other major web browsers for testing.

Applications For Writing Code:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3): My favorite text editor to use for programming, but [Atom](https://atom.io/) is pretty cool too.
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/): My favorite terminal because I like the typeface.
